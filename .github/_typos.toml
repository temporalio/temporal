# Inline typos ignore comments:
# To ignore a specific line, add a comment on the same line or the line before:
#   // typos:disable-next-line
#   var myVar = "mispeling"  // intentional
#
# To ignore a specific word on a line:
#   var myVar = "mispeling"  // typos:ignore
#
# To disable checking for an entire file, add at the top:
#   // typos:disable-file
#
# To check only changed files (useful for local development):
#   git diff --name-only --diff-filter=ACMR main...HEAD | typos --file-list -
# Or check only staged files:
#   git diff --cached --name-only | typos --file-list -
