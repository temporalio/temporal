		 	Posting this as a reminder to limit the number of signals coming through since we use CAN:

			Workflows cannot have infinitely-sized history and when the event count grows too large, `ContinueAsNew` can be returned
			to start a new one atomically. However, in order not to lose any data, signals must be drained and any other futures
			that need to be reacted to must be completed first. This means there must be a period where there are no signals to
			drain and no futures to wait on. If signals come in faster than processed or futures wait so long there is no idle
			period, `ContinueAsNew` will not happen in a timely manner and history will grow.
