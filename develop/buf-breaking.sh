# This script is intended to be run from the Makefile by the `buf-breaking` target.
#
# This uses the buf tool (https://buf.build/) to check our proto definitions for invalid
# changes. Because of limitations of buf (it doesn't support using images for
# dependencies), we use it by building our protos into images and then calling buf to
# compare images, instead of using buf's built-in git support. That means we have to use
# git manually to collect the versions we want to compare.
#
# We run two breaking checks: this commit against its PR merge base, and also this commit
# against the current head of main. Checking against the merge base is the one that will
# find most breakage, but it doesn't handle the case where protos are evolved in
# compatible ways in different directions on a feature branch vs the main branch, that are
# not compatible with each other. That case would hopefully be detected at merge time, but
# it's better to detect it early during feature branch development. The check against main
# handles that.
