# Code Review Skill

Apply these review patterns when reviewing code or suggesting changes.

@.github/copilot-instructions.md

## Review Output Format

When reviewing, organize feedback by priority:
1. **Must fix**: Issues that will cause bugs or break conventions
2. **Should fix**: Redundant code, naming issues, test correctness
3. **Nit**: Style preferences, minor improvements
