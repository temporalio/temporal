// RecycleToken should be called when the action being rate limited was not completed
// for some reason (i.e. a task is not dispatched because it was invalid).
// In this case, we want to immediately unblock another process that is waiting for one token
// so that the actual rate of completed actions is as close to the intended rate limit as possible.
// If no process is waiting for a token when RecycleToken is called, this is a no-op.
//
// For most rate limiters, recycle token is implemented in the base level ClockedRateLimiter,
// but because MultiRateLimiter implements WaitN by calling ReserveN on all its sub-rate-limiters,
// instead of WaitN, there is no one waiting on ClockedRateLimiter's recycle token channel.
// So MultiRateLimiter needs its own recycle method and channel.
//
// Since we don't know how many tokens were reserved by the process calling recycle, we will only unblock
// new reservations that are for one token (otherwise we could recycle a 1-token-reservation and unblock
// a 100-token-reservation). If all waiting processes are waiting for >1 tokens, this is a no-op.
//
// Because recycleCh is an unbuffered channel, the token will be reused for the next waiter only if
// there exists a waiter at the time RecycleToken is called. Usually the attempted rate is consistently
// above or below the limit for a period of time, so if rate limiting is in effect and recycling matters,
// most likely there will be a waiter. If the actual rate is erratically bouncing to either side of the
// rate limit AND we perform many recycles, this will drop some recycled tokens.
// If that situation turns out to be common, we may want to make it a buffered channel instead.
//
// Our goal is to ensure that each token in our bucket is used every second, meaning the time between
// taking and successfully using a token must be <= 1s. For this to be true, we must have:
//
//	time_to_recycle * number_of_recycles_per_second <= 1s
//	time_to_recycle * probability_of_recycle * number_of_attempts_per_second <= 1s
//
// Therefore, it is also possible for this strategy to be inaccurate if the delay between taking and
// successfully using a token is greater than one second.
//
// Currently, RecycleToken is called when we take a token to attempt a matching task dispatch and
// then later find out (usually via RPC to History) that the task should not be dispatched.
// If history rpc takes 10ms --> 100 opportunities for the token to be used that second --> 99% recycle probability is ok.
// If recycle probability is 50% --> need at least 2 opportunities for token to be used --> 500ms history rpc time is ok.
// Note that the task forwarder rate limit impacts the rate of recycle, which can add inaccuracy.
