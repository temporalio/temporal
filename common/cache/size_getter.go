// SizeGetter is an interface that can be implemented by cache entries to provide their size.
// Cache uses CacheSize() to determine the size of a cache entry.
// Please be aware that if the size of the cache entry changes while the cache is being used without pinning enabled,
// the cache won't be able to automatically adjust for this size change. In such instances, it's necessary to call Put()
// again to ensure the cache size remains accurate.
