// That performs a soft assertion by logging an error if the given condition is false.
// It is meant to indicate a condition that are always expected to be true.
// Returns true if the condition is met, otherwise false.
//
// Example:
// softassert.That(logger, object.state == "ready", "object is not ready")
//
// Best practices:
// - Use it to check for programming errors and invariants.
// - Use it to communicate assumptions about the code.
// - Use it to abort or recover from an unexpected state.
// - Never use it as a substitute for regular error handling, validation, or control flow.
func That(logger log.Logger, condition bool, msg string) bool {
	if !condition {
		// By using the same prefix for all assertions, they can be reliably found in logs.
		logger.Error("failed assertion: "+msg, tag.FailedAssertion)
	}
	return condition
}

// Fail logs an error message indicating a failed assertion.
// It works the same as That, but does not require a condition.
func Fail(logger log.Logger, msg string) {
	logger.Error("failed assertion: "+msg, tag.FailedAssertion)
}
