# Temporal

Temporal is a durable execution platform that enables developers to build scalable applications without sacrificing productivity or reliability.
The Temporal server executes units of application logic called Workflows in a resilient manner that automatically handles intermittent failures, and retries failed operations.

Temporal is a mature technology that originated as a fork of Uber's Cadence.
It is developed by [Temporal Technologies](https://temporal.io/), a startup by the creators of Cadence.

## Getting Started

### Download and Start Temporal Server Locally

Execute the following commands to start a pre-built image along with all the dependencies.

```bash
brew install temporal
temporal server start-dev
```

Refer to [Temporal CLI](https://docs.temporal.io/cli/#installation) documentation for more installation options.

### Run the Samples

Clone or download samples for [Go](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-go) or [Java](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-java) and run them with the local Temporal server.
We have a number of [HelloWorld type scenarios](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-java#helloworld) available, as well as more advanced ones. Note that the sets of samples are currently different between Go and Java.

### Use CLI

Use [Temporal CLI](https://docs.temporal.io/cli/) to interact with the running Temporal server.

```bash
temporal operator namespace list
temporal workflow list
```

### Use Temporal Web UI

Try [Temporal Web UI](https://docs.temporal.io/web-ui) by opening [http://localhost:8233](http://localhost:8233) for viewing your sample workflows executing on Temporal.

## Repository

This repository contains the source code of the Temporal server. To implement Workflows, Activities and Workers, use one of the [supported languages](https://docs.temporal.io/dev-guide/).
