This repo contains the source code of the Temporal server. To implement workflows, activities and worker use [Go SDK](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal-go-client) or [Java SDK](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal-java-client).

See Maxim's talk at [Data@Scale Conference](https://atscaleconference.com/videos/cadence-microservice-architecture-beyond-requestreply) for an architectural overview of Temporal.
