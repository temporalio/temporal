Visit [cadenceworkflow.io](https://cadenceworkflow.io) to learn about Cadence.

This repo contains the source code of the Cadence server. To implement workflows, activities and worker use [Go client](https://github.com/uber-go/cadence-client) or [Java client](https://github.com/uber-java/cadence-client).

See Maxim's talk at [Data@Scale Conference](https://atscaleconference.com/videos/cadence-microservice-architecture-beyond-requestreply) for an architectural overview of Cadence.

## Getting Started

### Start the cadence-server locally

We highly recommend that you use [Cadence service docker](docker/README.md) to run the service.

### Run the Samples

Try out the sample recipes for [Go](https://github.com/uber-common/cadence-samples) or [Java](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal-java-samples) to get started.

### Use CLI

Try out [Cadence command-line tool](tools/cli/README.md) to perform various tasks on Cadence

### Use Cadence Web

Try out [Cadence Web UI](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal-web) to view your workflows on Cadence.  
(This is already available at localhost:8088 if you run Cadence with docker compose)
